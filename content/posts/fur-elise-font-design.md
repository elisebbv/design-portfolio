This was a straightforward assignment from a graphic design professor at the University of the Fraser Valley. Using Adobe InDesign and/or Illustrator, as well as in-class instruction and supplemental notes, each student was directed to create their own font from scratch. The font had to include all letters from A-Z, could be either lowercase or uppercase, and needed to include an example of the font beind used in a sentence.
