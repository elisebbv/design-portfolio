## Website Editor, Jan 2024 - Present
Through my role as website editor at [Columbia Bible College](https://columbiabc.edu/), I updated their WordPress site to align with an updated visual branding guide.

- Designing custom templates based on the visual brand guide

- Designing graphics and editing photos to add to the site
- Strategizing and implementing updated website menu structure
- Updating the site page by page for mobile optimization 
- Communicating with marketing staff and contractors to coordinate website maintenance and updates
- Connecting analytics tracking for reporting purposes
- Building analytics reports for executive staff and review with stakeholders (board members, donors, etc.)
