## Digital Marketing & Tech Whiz, Mar 2022 - Aug 2024
At [Writer's Block Solutions](https://writersblocksolutions.ca/), I wore a lot of hats, including that of website designer. In collaboration with their website developer, I rebranded and updated the design and layout of their WordPress site to align with their refined visual branding guide. This involved incorporating the Elementor plugin into the WordPress infrastructure and adding pages to highlight the agency's service offerings.

### Primary Responsibilities

- Drafting wireframes in Canva to communicate the design vision to the web developer
- Collaborating with the web developer on implementing and troubleshooting the design
