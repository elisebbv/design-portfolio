## Website Designer, Sep-Nov 2024
As website designer for [Stratum Systems](https://stratum.it/), I met with their staff to develop a visual brand guide and a marketing strategy, and to discuss a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy for their marketing efforts moving forward. We chose Squarespace as a website platform, as Stratum's staff need to learn to update the website in-house. This involved choosing a base template from Squarespace's database and adapting the global styles (colours, fonts, layout, spacing) to suit the visual brand guide developed over previous projects.

### Primary Responsibilities
- Updating and refining the company's visual brand guide to include the correct colours, fonts, and assets
- Sorting through their current website for information to keep and/or discard
- Adapting the Squarespace template to match their visual brand guide
- Building out specified pages with the appropriate content, including adding Calls-to-Action (CTAs) for a streamlined user journey
- Testing and optimizing both mobile and desktop views
- Designing graphics and editing photos to add to the site
